# ohioCoronavirusMap
Displays a map of COVID-19 cases in Ohio by county

This project is currently deprecated due to the Ohio Department of Health's new COVID-19 Dashboard.

### Current Format
The project was initially designed to retrieve an HTML file of the [https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/] website. The HTML contained a list of counties with COVID-19 confirmed cases and the number per county.

### Future Format
Future plans will download a CSV of data from the ODH [here](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/home/dashboard) and parse the data to present results.
